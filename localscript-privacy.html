  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 12, 2026</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Short version:</strong> We collect nothing. All your voice data stays on your device permanently.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>We collect: Nothing.</strong></p>
  <p>LocalScript does not collect, transmit, store, or process any personal data on external servers. No analytics, no crash reporting, no usage tracking.</p>

  <h2>2. Voice Recordings & Transcripts</h2>
  <p>All audio recordings and transcripts are stored exclusively on your device using Apple's local storage. They are never uploaded to any server, cloud service, or third party.</p>

  <h2>3. On-Device Processing</h2>
  <p>All transcription is performed locally on your device using the Whisper Tiny Core ML model via Apple Neural Engine. No audio data is sent to any external service during or after transcription.</p>

  <h2>4. Network Activity</h2>
  <p>LocalScript makes zero outbound network connections during normal operation. This has been independently verified using Charles Proxy network monitoring.</p>

  <h2>5. iCloud Backup</h2>
  <p>Your recordings may be included in your device's standard iCloud Backup if you have iCloud Backup enabled in your iPhone settings. This backup is managed entirely by Apple under Apple's privacy policy and is not accessible to us.</p>

  <h2>6. Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>Subscription purchases are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not receive or store any payment information.</p>

  <h2>7. Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>This app is designed in compliance with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>GDPR Article 9 (EU General Data Protection Regulation)</li>
    <li>KVKK Article 6(3) (Turkish Personal Data Protection Law)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>LocalScript does not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under 13.</p>
